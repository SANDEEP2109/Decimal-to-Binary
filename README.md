# Decimal-to-Binary
This Python script provides a simple text-based interface for converting decimal numbers to binary. 
It presents the user with a menu that offers two options:

Convert a decimal number to binary.
Exit the program.
If the user selects the first option, they are prompted to enter a decimal number, which the program then converts to its binary equivalent using the decimal_to_binary function. The result is displayed to the user. If the user selects the second option, the program exits. If an invalid option is chosen, the program informs the user and re-displays the menu. The program runs in a loop, allowing for multiple conversions until the user decides to exit.
